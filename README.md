RWRGDR is a novel computational model proposed for drug repositioning through the utilization of the GraphSAGE for unsupervised feature learning, Graph Attention Network (GAT) for multi-head attention and the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm. The graphSAGE and RWR captures significant features within the local and global network perspectives, respectively for enhanced prediction performance, thus effectively identifying potential and novel indications for known or new drugs. The source code in this package implements the proposed approach using Python programming language amd Pytorch, resulting in a relatively superior prediction performance in comparison to prior models proposed.
